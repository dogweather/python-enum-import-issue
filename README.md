A small demo in which Python Enums aren't singletons.
This causes subtle bugs because `is` and `==` don't
work as expected.

This demo refers to the `Dog.PHOEBE` `Enum` twice. These
references turn out to be two separate instances.

Tested with Python 3.12.1

To run the demo:

```bash
python src/dog_house/main.py
```

Output:

```
The enums are not singletons: Dog.PHOEBE/4307352272 vs. Dog.PHOEBE/4307841440
phoebe_1 == phoebe_2: False
phoebe_1 is phoebe_2: False
```

---

The issue seems to be when a module (here, `db.py`) is imported in different ways
such as absolute vs. relative. Python seems to consider these different modules.
[This S.O. post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40371360/imported-enum-class-is-not-comparing-equal-to-itself/40371452) seems to be right.

## The three files in the demo

### db.py

```python
from enum import Enum


class Dog(Enum):
    PHOEBE = 'Phoebe'
    MARU   = 'Maru'

phoebe_1 = Dog.PHOEBE
```

### logic.py

```python
from db import Dog


phoebe_2 = Dog.PHOEBE
```

### main.py

```python
from dog_house.db import phoebe_1
from logic        import phoebe_2


if id(phoebe_1) != id(phoebe_2):
    print(f'The enums are not singletons: {phoebe_1}/{id(phoebe_1)} vs. {phoebe_2}/{id(phoebe_2)}')
    print(f'phoebe_1 == phoebe_2: {phoebe_1 == phoebe_2}')
    print(f'phoebe_1 is phoebe_2: {phoebe_1 is phoebe_2}')
else:
    print('They are the same object.')
```
